        <p>AI offers untold opportunities in almost every field known to mankind. It holds particular relevance in the field of healthcare. As per a figure by UK based Deloitte, the industry is currently pegged at $7.077 trillion

                                                      dollars that can balloon to $8.743 trillion by 2020. Given this astronomical figure, it’s no wonder that healthcare is being given a serious technological upgradation across various verticals.

                                                        US based Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) has taken help of Amazon Alexa to answer queries of parents regarding common ailments without the guardians having to come to the hospital complex. The "KidsMD™" Alexa skill was developed by the Innovation & Digital Health Accelerator (IDHA) team at. Devices enabled with Alexa, such as Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap and Amazon Fire TV, can help parents decide whether symptoms like fever, cough, headache, rash, vomiting, sore throat, diarrhea, fatigue or shortness of breath warrant a call to the doctor--all by using the convenience of voice.

                                                        “The KidsMD™ skill makes it easier to access medical information from Boston Children's Hospital, a world-class medical institution. That access is important for all of our Alexa customers, and particularly parents," says Rob Pulciani, Amazon Alexa Director.</p>

                                                       to precisely and safely eliminate a diseased cell or or organ part so that a patient suffering is drastically reduced. Targeted delivery of medicines, nanomedicines and robotic surgery are some of the breakthrough medical advancements that have occured due to intervention of AI and data science. It’s in this context that San Francisco based Atomwise’s research in incorporating AI into drug therapy becomes noteworthy.

                                                        Atomwise’s technology uses a statistical approach that extracts the insights from millions of experimental affinity measurements and thousands of protein structures to predict the binding of small molecules to proteins. This fundamental tool makes it possible for chemists to pursue hit discovery, lead optimization and toxicity predictions with unparalleled precision and accuracy.

                                                        Han Lim, MD, PhD, Vice President, Global Head of Partnering at Atomwise adds, “Researchers who were previously unable to investigate new drug treatments can now do so because we have removed barriers impeding their efforts. Specifically, we provide them with access to AI screening technology and medicinal chemistry know-how, and eliminate the high cost and enormous time required for physical screening of compounds."</p>
